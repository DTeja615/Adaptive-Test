Define the principal focus of a concave mirror.,Medium,Descriptive,,Light,2,2,It is a point on the principal axis where the rays of light parallel to principal axis meet.,"principal focus, concave mirror, principal axis"
Name a mirror that can give an erect and enlarged image of an object.,Medium,Descriptive,,Light,2,2,Concave mirror.,"concave mirror, erect and enlarged image"
Why do we prefer a convex mirror as a rear-view mirror in vehicles?,Medium,Descriptive,,Light,2,2,Convex mirror can cover a wider range and give erect and diminished image. Hence convex mirror is used as a rear-view mirror to get wider field of view.,"convex mirror, rear-view mirror, vehicle, wide, field of view"
A ray of light travelling in cur enters obliquely into water. Does the light ray bend towards the normal or away form the normal? Why?,Medium,Descriptive,,Light,2,2,The light bends towards the normal on entry into water because water is optically denser than air.,"light, ray, bend, water, normal, denser"
"You are given kerosene, turpentine and water. In which of these does the light travel fastest? Refractive index of kerosene = 1.44, Refractive index of turpentine = 1.47, Refractive index of water = 1.33.",Medium,Descriptive,,Light,2,2,Lower the refractive index faster is the speed of light in that medium. Hence light will travel fastest in water.,"light, travel, fast, refractive index, speed of light, medium"
What is meant by power of accommodation of the eye?,Medium,Descriptive,,Human Eye,2,2,The ability of the eye to focus the distant objects as well as the nearby objects on the retina by changing the focal length of the eye lens is called power of accommodation.,"power, accommodation, eye, retina, focal length"
A person with a myopic eye cannot see objects beyond 1.2 m distance What should be the type of the corrective lens used to restore proper vision?,Medium,Descriptive,,Human Eye,2,2,A person with a myopic eye can use concave lens to restore proper vision.,"myopic eye, concave lens, restore, vision"
What is the far point and near point of the human eye with normal vision?,Medium,Descriptive,,Human Eye,2,2,The far point is infinity and the near point is 25 cm of the human eye with normal vision.,"far point, near point, human eye, normal vision"
The radius of curvature of a spherical mirror is 20 cm. What is its focal length?,Medium,Mathematical,,Light,2,2,https://www.careerlauncher.com/cbse-ncert/class-10/10-Sci-Light-Ref-nce-Untitle0.JPG,"radius, curvature, spherical mirror, focal length"
Find the focal length of a convex mirror whose radius of curvature is 32 cm.,Medium,Mathematical,,Light,2,2,https://www.careerlauncher.com/cbse-ncert/class-10/10-Sci-Light-Ref-nce-Untitle1.JPG,"focal length, convex mirror, radius of curvature"
A convex lens forms a real and inverted image of a needle at a distance of 50 cm from it. Where is the needle placed in front of the convex lens if the image is equal to the size of the object? Also find the power of the lens.,Hard,Mathematical,,Light,5,5,https://www.careerlauncher.com/cbse-ncert/class-10/10-Sci-Light-Ref-nce-Untitle6.JPG,"convex lens, real image, inverted image, power of lens"
The far point of a myopic person is 80 cm in front of the eye. What is the nature and power of the lens required to correct the problem?,Hard,Mathematical,,Human Eye,5,5,https://www.careerlauncher.com/cbse-ncert/class-10/10th-Hu-col-nce-UntitOE1.JPG,"myopic person, power of lens"
Why does the sky appear dark instead of blue to an astronaut?,Hard,Descriptive,,Human Eye,5,5,"In space there are no particles, air, gases, water droplets etc., present to scatter the light. So when the astronauts look at the sky in the space, there is no light entering our eyes, hence it appears dark.","sky, dark, astronaut, scatter, light"
Why does the sun appear reddish early in the morning?,Hard,Descriptive,,Human Eye,5,5,"When the sun rises early in the morning (or set in the evening), the light from sun travels through the thicker layer of air and larger distance of the atmosphere surrounding the earth. Hence the blue light scatters the most but red light does not scatters and reaches our eyes.","sun, red, early, morning"

The change in focal length of an eye lens is caused by the action of the,Easy,mcq,pupil |retina |ciliary muscles |iris,Human Eye,1,1,(c) ciliary muscles,"change, focal length, eye, lens, action"
Which one of the following materials cannot be used to make a lens?,Easy,mcq,Water |Glass |Plastic |Clay,Light,1,1,(d) Clay,"material, used, make, lens"
"No matter how far stand from a mirror, your image appears erect. The mirror is likely to be",Easy,mcq,plane |concave |convex |either plane or convex,Light,1,1,(d) either plane or convex,"mirror, image, erect"
Where should an object be placed in front of a convex lens to get a real image of the size of the object?,Easy,mcq,At the principal focus of the lens |At twice the focal length |At infinity |Between the optical centre of the lens and its principal focus,Light,1,1,(b) At twice the focal length,"convex lens, real image, size of object"
