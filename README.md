 “Education is the only way to win the world. It is to think deeply about something till its roots and understand the intention behind it”. 	
         - Unknown
Education is the social institution through which society provides its members with important knowledge, including basic facts, job skills, and cultural norms values. 

This year alone we have witnessed an investment of about $5.6 trillion on education and training globally by governments, educational institutes, families, etc. and it is expected to grow by 4.5% between the years 2021-2026. 

Undeniably, education plays a crucial role in reducing poverty and inequality and laying a foundation for sustained economic growth. Governments are expected to develop and implement strategies that promote education and enrolment of students. High-enrolment in education can translate into more skilled labour, which can provide a positive impact on a country’s GDP.

One of the most important benefits of an education at an individual level is that it improves lives and helps society to run smoothly. Therefore, assessments are a way to test the skills acquired.

Assessment evaluates the student’s ability of learning. It is an analysis of the student’s understanding, a measurement of how much they learn. The primary goal of assessments is for self-improvement. 

The level of modern assessment evaluation can be further enhanced by unlocking the potential of adaptive assessments.
